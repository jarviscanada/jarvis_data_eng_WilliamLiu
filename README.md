# William Liu . Jarvis Consulting

I am a candidate for Master of Applied Sciences in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I currently hold a degree in Bachelor of Applied Sciences in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am interested to work with unique and interesting datasets and to discover how leveraging those datasets may impact various lines of service in the financial sector. During my work experience and coursework, I have been involved in various projects, through which I have gained experience in machine learning and deep learning techniques. In addition to my experience in machine learning and deep learning, I am also proficient in software, automation, and manufacturing. I have worked extensively with SQL as back-end to web and mobile applications and I am well versed in several programming languages including but not limited to Python, C#, and Java. I am driven, results-oriented and accustomed to fast-paced work environments. I believe that I still have much to learn, but I am eager to take on new learning opportunities. I am passionate about continuous learning, and I hope to be an asset to your team.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_WilliamLiu](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_WilliamLiu)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_WilliamLiu/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a resource management tool that consistently records a system's CPU, memory, and disk I/O consumption data. The Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent (LCMA) can be deployed multiple nodes on a Linux cluster, connected through a network switch. Each node is equipped with a Linux-based operating system: CentOS 7, and shares a PostgreSQL relational database management system (RDBMS) with the other nodes in the cluster. Several bash scripts are constructed to set up the database instance through docker containers as well as collect and update the database with resource usage data over specified one-minute intervals.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_WilliamLiu/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: In development
  - JDBC App: Developed an application that allows users' manipulating a PostgreSQL database through Java programming. The application is equipped with the ability to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Customer and Order data. The Data Access Object (DAO) pattern is implemented to manipulate Data Transfer Objects (DTO).
  - Grep App: Developed an application to facilitate recursive text-searching based on regular expressions. Given a root directory, the application searches through all files and subdirectories for matches to a specific pattern. The application is deployed through a docker image to ensure consistent runtime environments as well as implements core Java file I/O Stream APIs and Lambda functions, managed with Apache Maven.

**Petals Transfer Learning** [[GitHub](https://www.kaggle.com/williamyll/petals-transfer-learning)]: Classification of 100 different types of flowers using a transfer learning model.

**Pattern Recognition**: Human activity recognition based on smartphone signals using random forest classification. Dataset used: UCI-HAR.

**Medical Imaging**: Brain tumor segmentation and classification using transfer learning. Dataset used: T1-weighted images of meningioma, glioma and pituitary tumours.

**Graphical Deep Learning**: Learning kernel-based activation functions from data. Datasets used: CIFAR-10, MNIST.
