  "summary": "I am a candidate for Master of Applied Sciences in Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I currently hold a degree in Bachelor of Applied Sciences in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am interested to work with unique and interesting datasets and to discover how leveraging those datasets may impact various lines of service in the financial sector. During my work experience and coursework, I have been involved in various projects, through which I have gained experience in machine learning and deep learning techniques. In addition to my experience in machine learning and deep learning, I am also proficient in software, automation, and manufacturing. I have worked extensively with SQL as back-end to web and mobile applications and I am well versed in several programming languages including but not limited to Python, C#, and Java. I am driven, results-oriented and accustomed to fast-paced work environments. I believe that I still have much to learn, but I am eager to take on new learning opportunities. I am passionate about continuous learning, and I hope to be an asset to your team."
